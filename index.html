         <h1>What is Multiple Sclerosis?</h1>
         
         <p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS). 
             While the etiology of MS is still largely unknown, epidemiologists have seen an increased 
             prevalence of MS in countries at high latitudes, where the sunlight is limited and where the populations
             have vitamin D deficiency and high melatonin levels. </p>
             <p> <img src='http://www.lynneavillanovamd.com/wp-content/uploads/MS-drawing-e1423945698449.jpg' class= "col-4" id='abstract-image-nerve' alt="DeMyelination of Nerve"/></p> 
             
             <h1>Vitamin D and MS Connection?</h1>
             
             <p>There are primarily two ways to get vitamin D are by exposing your bare skin to sunlight and by taking vitamin D supplements. You can’t get the right amount of vitamin D your body needs from food.
                The most natural way to get vitamin D is by exposing your bare skin to sunlight (ultraviolet B rays). This can happen very quickly, 
                particularly in the summer. You don’t need to tan or burn your skin to get vitamin D. You only need to expose your skin for around half 
                the time it takes for your skin to begin to burn. How much vitamin D is produced from sunlight depends on the time of day, where you live 
                in the world and the color of your skin. The more skin you expose the more vitamin D is produced.</p>
                
                <p>Spending time outdoors during the summer 
                appears to have a strong association between reduced future risk for MS, a new study suggests. Results showed that living in an area with 
                higher ambient UVB levels (top tertile) was associated with a 36% to 
                45% reduced risk for MS across all age groups combined compared with those with the lowest tertile UVB exposure. </p>
                <p>    
             
             <h1>How Much Sun Do You Need?</h1>
             
            <p>Allow 10 to 15 minutes or so of unprotected sun exposure to your arms, legs, abdomen and back. After that, 
            follow up with good sun protection, like a 30-SPF or higher sunblock.
            Choose the right time of day. If your shadow is longer than your body height, you can't make any vitamin D.
            Between 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. is the usual window for significant sun exposure, h. This app 
            uses multiple factors – time of day, location – to recommend optimal
            sun exposure and provide sun-safety warnings.  </p>
            
            <p>In the winter, it's virtually impossible to produce vitamin D from the sun if you live 37 degrees above
             the equator (or north of Atlanta), because the sun never gets high enough in the sky for its ultraviolet
              B rays to penetrate the atmosphere, according to Harvard Womens' Health Watch. But summer is a great time 
              to stock up on the nutrient. When the sun's UV-B rays hit the skin, a reaction takes place that enables 
              skin cells to manufacture vitamin D. </p>

              <p>The amount of sunlight needed varies greatly between individuals. Use this app as a general guidline and always consult your physician.
                Due to many factors, sometimes Vitamin D supplementation is needed. It is also recommended to have your Vitamin D levels checked before beginning supplementation.</p>
